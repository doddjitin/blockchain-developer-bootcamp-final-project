problem: comfort when sending large amounts of ETH

solution:
- sender: sends ETH to a dapp along with a password (hashed)
- receiver: learns about password through social/IRL and unlocks the corresponding amount of funds from the dapp
- extras: timeouts on sends (returned back to sender if no one claims within some period)
